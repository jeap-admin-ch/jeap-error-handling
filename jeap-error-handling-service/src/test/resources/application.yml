    # For tests, skip migrations 1.0.0 and 1.1.0, because 1.1.0 contains postgres-specific table column type cast statements
    # that migrate some ID columns from varchar to UUID.
    # For tests, the schema will be created with a h2-compatible script with version 1.1.1, which already has the UUID
    # type ID columns integrated.
    # Starting with migration version 1.2.0, the scripts will be the same for both integration tests and productive code
    # Separating the scripts into postgres-specific folders would have impact on client applications as they would have
    # to change their flyway location configuration property, which is a breaking change we strive to avoid.
